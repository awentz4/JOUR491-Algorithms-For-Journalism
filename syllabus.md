**Course description:**

On the morning of March 14, 2014, Ken Schwencke rolled out of bed, logged into the LA Times content management system and published a story about an earthquake that happened three minutes prior. 

This is interesting only in the particulars: Schwencke didn't write a word of the story - no human did. The story was written by software. Specifically, a algorithm programmed by Schwencke to write a story about earthquakes minutes after they happen, so the LA Times can have something on its website about it first, and faster than any human can do the job. All Schwencke had to do was check the story to see if the script did its job and hit publish.

Welcome to the dawning age of algorithms in journalism. Programs now write stories so humans don't have to. They now write simple stories about softball games, corporate earnings reports, the weather and, yes, earthquakes. Some of them are extraordinarily simple -- basic programming knowledge is all that's required. Others are quite sophisticated -- they rely on more complex tools to arrive at a simple story. 

This course is going to take your journalism education and combine it with some programming knowledge and an introduction to algorithms. We'll discuss the ethics, the practicality, the limits, the nature of what it means to be human and we'll apply algorithms to news problems to see what we can learn about both. 

**Course goals:**

1. Gain introductory knowledge of algorithms as a component of computer science. 
2. Gain introductory knowledge of how algorithms are being used in the context of journalism.
3. Explore applications of algorithms to journalistic problems.
4. Apply teachings to a journalism problem and deploy it publicly.

**Open lab hours:**

Each Friday throughout the semester, I run something called Maker Hours. It’s an open learning time where anyone who wants to learn about some digital tool or technology can come in and I’ll help. It’s in Room 27 from 1-5. You’re welcome to come learn something new outside of class, or bring your class stuff with you to get questions answered. 

**Required materials:**

* Assigned readings from the internet.
* [Guide to Automated Journalism](http://towcenter.org/research/guide-to-automated-journalism/)
* [Intro to Algorithms by Thomas J. Coren et al](http://0-site.ebrary.com.library.unl.edu/lib/unebraskalincoln/reader.action?docID=10397652). Link is to an online version free through UNL libraries.
* A GitHub account.
* A laptop computer that you bring with you to class.
* Administrative rights to install software.
* An abundant sense of curiosity and no fear of failure.
* A sense of humor. 

**Student guided teaching**

In this class, you will each be assigned a chapter in the Intro to Algorithms Textbook and will be required to teach that chapter on your assigned day. You will lecture for 30 minutes on the chapter. Each of you will read the chapter, the assigned person will go over it. The batting order, chosen at random is:

|Student|Chapter|Presentation Date|
|-------|-------|-----------------||Adrian|2|Jan. 24||Andrew|3|Jan. 31||Anthony|4|Feb. 7||Aaron|5|Feb. 14||Aidan|7|Feb. 21|
|Alex|Arr|Feb. 28|

For Alex's presentation, read [Accountability in Algorithmic Decision Making](http://www.nickdiakopoulos.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Accountability-in-algorithmic-decision-making-Final.pdf) and [Algorithmic Accountability Reporting: On the Investigation of Black Boxes](http://cjrarchive.org/img/posts/tow-content/uploads/2014/02/78524_Tow-Center-Report-WEB-1.pdf).

Your lectures will include an overview of the chapter in English; a discussion of how it fits into our understanding of algorithms so far; a proposed application for news or journalism; and a topic for a discussion that you will lead.

**Projects**

In this class, we're going to accomplish four projects, centered on solving journalistic problems with algorithms and data. The projects will be short burn, conception to launch, called sprints. The four project sprints will be. 

* **Build your own Twitter bot**: One of the easiest things you can do with basic algorithmic decision making is a Twitter bot. We'll explore how news organizations and others have used Twitter bots and we'll make our own civic-minded news driven Twitter bots using Python.

* **Build your own chat bot**: News organizations are jumping into chat bots as a way to interact with audiences. How do they work? What do they do? What else could news organizations do with them?

* **Using public data to automate news tips**: More and more, governments are making their data available in open formats. How could we use those datasets to add context to news and alert reporters when not-normal events happen according to the data?
 
* **Using public data to automate journalism**: Taking all that we've learned, plus a few new tricks, how could we automate the entire process of journalism? Can a bot write a story? Could it write credible stories? Could it do so in a way to make people believe it wasn't a bot? You're going to try.

I use standard and basic grading scale.

|Grade|Percentage|
|-----|----------|
|A+|97-100|						
|A|93-96|
|A-|90-92|
|B+|87-89|
|B|83-86|
|B-|80-82|
|C+|77-79|
|C|73-76|						
|C-|70-72|	
|D+|67-69|
|D|63-66|					 
|D-|60-62|
|F|59 or below|

However, your final letter grade will be weighted:
|Assignment|Weight||----------|------|
|Reading quizzes/minor assignments|12%|
|Twitter bot|22%||Chat bot|22%||Automated news tips|22%|
|Automated news|22%|__Notes on participation:__ I do not take attendance, but it's a small enough class that I'll notice when you're gone. Your attendance and participation will factor into your grade thusly: When the end of the semester comes around, I made decisions on rounding and reconsiderations based on participation and attendance. If you show up, participate in class and are a positive contribution to the class overall, I round, sometimes generously. If you skip classes, mess around on your laptop, sit in silence when partipation is needed, then your grade is your grade. Either way, you earned it.


__Notes on attendance:__

Yes, we all get sick. Yes, things happen. I don’t want you to be sick in my class any more than you want to be sick. You’ve got no fewer than five ways to get ahold of me. If you are going to miss class, tell me before class. We’ll work it out. But you have to tell me before class for me to help you.

This said: this class builds each class onto the next one. Miss a class, especially a code class, and you are behind. You’re going to be covering a lot of new material in this class. Miss one at your own peril.

__Policies__Here's the short version.You cheat, you fail, no exceptions. If I’m doing something that’s keeping you from learning, tell me. Tell the Dean. Tell someone, because that’s not cool. I won’t tolerate it from myself and you shouldn’t either.
Now the longer versions.__ACEJMC Competencies__

After this class, you should be able to:

* Demonstrate an understanding of the history and role of professionals and institutions in shaping communications;
* Demonstrate an understanding of professional ethical principles and work ethically in pursuit of truth, accuracy, fairness and diversity;
* Understand concepts and apply theories in the use and presentation of images and information;
* Think critically, creatively and independently;
* Conduct research and evaluate information by methods appropriate to the communications professions in which they work;
* Apply basic numerical and statistical concepts;
* Apply tools and technologies appropriate for the communications professions in which they work.

__Academic integrity:__

Every student must adhere to the policy on academic integrity set forth in the UNL Student Code of Conduct as outlined in the UNL Bulletin. Students who plagiarize may receive a failing grade on an assignment or for an entire course and may be reported to the Student Judicial Review Board. The work a student submits in a class must be the student's own work and must be work completed for that particular class and assignment. Students wishing to build on an old project or work on a similar project in two classes must discuss this with both professors.

Academic dishonesty includes:

* handing in another's work or part of another's work as your own.
* turning in one of your old papers (including something you wrote in high school) for a current class.
* turning in the same or similar paper for two different classes,
using notes or other study aids or otherwise obtaining another's answers for a quiz or an examination.

Anything and everything you include in your papers that comes from another source must be attributed with proper citation. That includes ideas and opinions. 

Plagiarism consists of using phrases, sentences or paragraphs from any source and republishing them without alteration or attribution. The sources include, but are not limited to, books, magazines, newspapers, television or radio reports, Web sites and other students’ papers.

__Students with disabilities:__

Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor for a confidential discussion of their individual needs for academic accommodation. It is the policy of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to provide flexible and individualized accommodation to students with documented disabilities that may affect their ability to fully participate in course activities or meet course requirements. To receive accommodation services, students must be registered with the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office, 132 Canfield Administration, 472-3787 voice or TTY.

__Diversity:__

The College of Journalism and Mass Communications values diversity, in the broadest sense of the word – gender, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, income, religion, education, geographic, physical and mental ability or disability, sexual orientation. We recognize that understanding and incorporating diversity in the curriculum enables us to prepare our students for careers as professional communicators in a global society. As communicators, we understand that journalism, advertising and other forms of strategic communication must reflect society in order to be effective and reliable. We fail as journalists if we are not accurate in our written, spoken and visual reports; including diverse voices and perspectives improves our accuracy and truthfulness. In advertising, we cannot succeed if we do not understand the value of or know how to create advertising that reflects a diverse society and, thus, appeals to broader audiences.
