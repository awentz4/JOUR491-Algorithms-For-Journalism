**Course description:**

On the morning of March 14, 2014, Ken Schwencke rolled out of bed, logged into the LA Times content management system and published a story about an earthquake that happened three minutes prior. 

This is interesting only in the particulars: Schwencke didn't write a word of the story - no human did. The story was written by software. Specifically, a algorithm programmed by Schwencke to write a story about earthquakes minutes after they happen, so the LA Times can have something on its website about it first, and faster than any human can do the job. All Schwencke had to do was check the story to see if the script did its job and hit publish.

Welcome to the dawning age of algorithms in journalism. Programs now write stories so humans don't have to. They now write simple stories about softball games, corporate earnings reports, the weather and, yes, earthquakes. Some of them are extraordinarily simple -- basic programming knowledge is all that's required. Others are quite sophisticated -- they rely on more complex tools to arrive at a simple story. 

This course is going to take your journalism education and combine it with some programming knowledge and an introduction to algorithms. We'll discuss the ethics, the practicality, the limits, the nature of what it means to be human and we'll apply algorithms to news problems to see what we can learn about both. 

**Course goals:**

1. Gain introductory knowledge of algorithms as a component of computer science. 
2. Gain introductory knowledge of how algorithms are being used in the context of journalism.
3. Explore applications of algorithms to journalistic problems.
4. Apply teachings to a journalism problem and deploy it publicly.
